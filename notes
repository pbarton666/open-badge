Notes:

This version has some upgrades from the previous:

- all setup parameters are editalbe via a configuration file (no coding required)
- ability to specify and produce special tickets simultaneously with others
- system will handle arbitrary layouts and easy conversion to different formats
- heads off some some font conflict errors in reportlab.

To do (maybe):

- probably want to build a package w/ the dependencies

potentially want to have ability to include bar codes or equivalent to encode
user's contact info (something scannable)

    there's some other programs out there including
    http://www.red-bean.com/labelnation
    
    there's a barcode generator that uses postscript at:
    http://code.google.com/p/elaphe/source/browse/trunk/elaphe/maxicode.py?r=48
    (not sure how well postscript encoding works and plays with pdf)
    
    There's a project that renders complex bar codes at.  Seems to work so far.
    Requires PIL (Python imaging library) and ghostscript.
